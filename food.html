                    <h2>Tempoyak</h2>
                    <p>Tempoyak is one of the most popular culinary dishes in Kalimantan, and Bengkayang is known for producing the best durian. Tempoyak is made from fermented durian pulp, creating a unique sour-sweet-savory flavor. It is commonly processed into a spicy and savory chili paste, cooked with fried anchovies, or used as a stir-fry seasoning. It is a must-have side dish during durian season.</p>

                    <h2>Pulut Kantong Semar</h2>
                    <p>This is a very unique Dayak culinary dish and an example of local wisdom. Glutinous rice is cooked inside the natural pitcher of a pitcher plant (a type of carnivorous plant) as a substitute for banana leaves or bamboo. The rice is cooked until it is done and has a distinct aroma, often served during traditional ceremonies.</p>

                    <h2>Bubur Pedas</h2>
                    <p>Although it is more known as a Sambas Malay dish, it is easy to find and popular in Bengkayang. Despite its name meaning "spicy," the spiciness is not dominant. The savory taste comes from a mixture of roasted rice, grated coconut, and various forest vegetables such as ferns, star gooseberry leaves, and polygonum leaves (which give it a unique aroma). This porridge is often served with a sprinkle of peanuts and fried anchovies.</p>

                    <h2>Choi Pan</h2>
                    <p>Although more well-known in Pontianak and Singkawang, Choi Pan is also easy to find in Bengkayang. It is a very popular snack. It consists of small cakes filled with vegetables (usually jicama or chives) wrapped in a thin rice flour skin, steamed, and served with a sprinkle of fried garlic and a spicy vinegar dipping sauce.</p>

                    <p>This is a popular dessert, especially at Chinese food stalls. It is made from hulled green beans and cooked into a thick porridge. It is served with a light sweetness and savory taste, and its texture is smoother and cleaner than regular green bean porridge.</p>
